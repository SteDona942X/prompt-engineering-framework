## üìä Scoring Methodologies

### Standard 1-10 Scale
```markdown
## Score Interpretation Guide

**9-10: Exceptional**
- Exceeds expectations significantly
- Best-in-class performance
- Minimal improvement needed

**7-8: Good**
- Meets expectations well
- Strong performance with minor areas for improvement
- Recommended with small refinements

**5-6: Acceptable**
- Meets basic requirements
- Adequate performance with notable improvement opportunities
- Conditional approval with specific enhancements

**3-4: Below Standard**
- Does not meet expectations
- Significant improvement required
- Requires major revision before approval

**1-2: Poor**
- Far below expectations
- Fundamental issues requiring complete rework
- Not recommended for approval
```

### Weighted Scoring Calculation
```markdown
## Weighted Score Formula

**Step 1**: Assign individual scores (1-10) for each criterion
**Step 2**: Multiply each score by its weight percentage
**Step 3**: Sum all weighted scores for final score

**Example**:
- Criterion A: 8/10 √ó 40% = 3.2 points
- Criterion B: 6/10 √ó 35% = 2.1 points  
- Criterion C: 7/10 √ó 25% = 1.75 points
- **Total**: 7.05/10 overall score
